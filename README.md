#### 5 day intensive course conducted by Google/DeepMinds AI team jointly with Kaggle
## Instructions
#### First: Listen to the 1) Podcast produced using NotebookLM for Lessons, explaining whitepaper that is the basis for each lesson 2) Recorded Webinar with Google/DeepMinds Developers responsible for each whitepaper. 
- Follow link to YouTube recordings https://youtu.be/1CC39K76Nqs?si=V4yUCc04f8Rtm-cg
#### Second: Sign up for an  AI Studio account and ensure you can generate an API key, save the API Key under Google_API_Key.  
- Follow link to Google AI Studio to generate API Key, [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio)
- If you want to run the Notebooks in Kaggle, sign up for a Kaggle account, https://www.kaggle.com/# 
- Make sure to phone verify your Kaggle account, it’s necessary for the course’s code labs. Alternatively, you can also run these on Google Colab or locally on Jupyter Notebook.
## Content
#### Day-1-Prompting
- Today you’ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You’ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.
- Complete this code lab on Kaggle where you’ll learn prompting fundamentals. Make sure you phone verify your account before starting, it's necessary for the code labs.
- The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.
#### Day-2-Embeddings and Vector Database
- Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You’ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data.
- Complete this code lab on Kaggle where you will build a RAG question-answering system over custom documents
- Explore text similarity with embeddings
- Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings
#### Day-3-Agents
- Today you will learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.
- The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.
#### Day-4-Domain Specific LLMs
- Today you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM (cybersecurity) and MedLM/Med-PaLM (medicine), with insights from the researchers who built them.
- In the code labs you will learn how to add real world data to a model beyond its knowledge cut-off by grounding with Google Search.  You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
#### Day-5-Bonus with extra API Features to try
- ML Ops and extra AI features
- Link to GitHub for Starter Pack in ML Ops for AI: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/sample-apps/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack
